THIS AGREEMENT IS A "SATIRE". OR IS IT?

My idea, if you will, members of CodeusProject, is to form a business 'alliance', basically meaning I work in your ficitious company, for exchange of my services. 
Why? you ask, dumbfounded in your (doubtless) wheeled and comforted chairs. I will answer. The answer is, because it is in the mutual benefit of both parties. 
It has no cost to me and to you, and there are benefits as I can provide some obscure services, like filling up your organisation. And then you canw give me the privilege of being in an organisation.
