THIS AGREEMENT IS A "SATIRE". OR IS IT?

My idea, if you will, members of CodeusProject, is to form a business 'alliance', basically meaning I work in your ficitious company, for exchange of my services. 
Why? you ask, dumbfounded in your (doubtless) wheeled and comforted chairs. I will answer. The answer is, because it is in the mutual benefit of both parties.
